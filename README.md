# dynatopGIS

This R package coontains the core code to generate dynamic TOPMODEL structures
from GIS data

## TO DO
* Check burning of layters and add to vignette
* Check function documentation for consistency

## Suggestions
* Check the use of large (out of memory) GIS files, particularly how to use with the Rcpp functions
* Improve iterative algorithms (iterations should not be needed in many
cases!!)
* Test speed up of moving further components to Rcpp
