Resubmission

Thanks to Gregor Sayer for the constructive feedback.

*Response to previous comments*

If there are references describing the methods in your package, please add these
- Two references added to description text in DESCRIPTION

Please always explain all acronyms in the description text.
- Acronyms removed. Note TOPMODEL is a name traditionally spelt in capitals,
text has been added to clarify what it is.

Please always write package names, software names and API (application
programming interface) names in single quotes in title and description. e.g:
--> 'dynatop'
- Done

Please add small executable examples in your Rd-files if possible, to illustrate the use of the exported function but also enable automatic testing.
- Added to documentation with use of \donttest to keep run times within 5s
