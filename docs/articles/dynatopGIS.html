<p>The purpose of this vignette is to provide an outline of the steps needed to build a dynamic TOPMODEL implimentation using the dynatopGIS package.</p>
<div id="principles-behind-dynatopgis" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#principles-behind-dynatopgis" class="anchor"></a>Principles behind dynatopGIS</h1>
<p>The dynatopGIS package is designed to work with a structured data flow, where by GIS data are processed through intermediate stages until one or more dynamic TOPMODEL implimentations are produced. The process GIS data of the intermediate stages are written into files with a common directory that acts as record of the work undertaken. Coupling this with a document such as this vignette which documents the workflow should significantly enhance the chances of ensuring the work is reproducable.</p>
<p>The basis of the analysis is presumed to be a rasterised Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the catchment and a vectorised representation of the river network with attributes. Current these can be in any format supported by the  and  libraries.</p>
<p>There are however a number of limitations * Within the calculations of the gradient used within the sink filling, flow routing and topographic index calculation the raster DEM is presumed to be in a projection that is has square or rectangular cells such that the difference between the cells centers (in meters) does not alter. * Intermediate files are written in GeoTIFF and shapefile format. The GeoTIFF does not keep projection information, however the dimensions asn projection of the original DEM are maintained</p>

<p>Reading the river channel data is more complex since each vector object in the GIS file is treated as a length of river reach and requires the following properties * <em>chanel_id</em> - the identifier of which model dynamic TOPMODEL channel HRU the vector object belongs to * <em>width</em> - the width of the channel length * <em>endNode</em> - a label for the downstream end of the river length * <em>startNode</em> - a label for the upstream end of the river length * <em>length</em> - the length in meters</p>
<p>Currently only the channel_id and width properties are used, but it is considered in later releases that the remaining properties will describe the connectivity of the river network and distance from outlet.</p>
<p>These properties are provided to the  function as a named vector, in the case of Swindale</p>

<p>Having loaded the channel and DEM the next stage is to combine the channel network and the DEM. the  function acheives this by intersecting the DEM and river network to determine which of the raster DEM cells contain parts of the river network. From this three raster maps are produced containing: * the area in the DEM cell covered by land * the area in the DEM cell covered by channel * the id of the channel If multiple river lengths intersect a DEM cell the id of that with the largest intersection is used.</p>

<p>For the hillslope to be connected to the rivernework the hillslope parts of the DEM but drain to the DEM cells which intersect with the river network.</p>
<p>While no check is enforced on the full connectivity ofthe catchment a basic requirement is that there are no sinks: that is DEM pixels which are lower then their neighbours and not intersected by the network. The algorithm implimented in the  function tries to ensure this using a relatively simple iterative algorithm. te execution time of the function is limited by capping the number of iterations of the algorithm, howver the algorithm can be restarted and the minimum gradient adjuest from the default of 1m in 1km.</p>
<p>For Swindale, where the example DEM is already partially filled the algorithm finishes quickly and the changes in the DEM are minor</p>

<a href="#spliting-into-hydrological-response-units" class="anchor"></a>Spliting into Hydrological response units</h2>
<p>Hillslope hydrological response units can be created from the underlying data in two ways within the  package. The first method, <em>spliting</em> allows the landscep to be divided up based on breaks in the values of landscape feature values. The second <em>burning</em> enforeces classes onto distinct area. It is presumed that burnt classes will always be imposed upon an initial characterisation through splitting.</p>
<p>To split a catchment into HRUs the breaks between the classes need to be specified. This is done by forming a named  of cuts. the names correspond to GeoTiff files within the project directory while teh values of the variables should be numeric and define either the number of bands (single value) or breaks between split classes (multiple values).</p>
<p>For example to generate HRUs for Swindale by dividing the topographic index into 21 classes and sve the output classes as  in the project folder:</p>
