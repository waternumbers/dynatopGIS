\title{cpp wrapper function for passing up the catchments from river nodes}
\usage{
rcpp_compute_properties(dem, channel_id, land_area, offset, dx, cl)
}
\arguments{
\item{dem}{Digital elevation model as a vector}

\item{channel_id}{UID of channel present in the pixel}

\item{land_area}{Area of land surface in pixel}

\item{offset}{- difference between cell index of adjacent cells and current cell index - clockwise from top left}

\item{dx}{distance between cell centres - from top left in clockwise direction}

\item{cl}{contour length - from top left in a clockwise direction. The 9th value is used for cells split beteen land and channel}
}
\value{
a list with the filled dem, order, upslope_area, contour_length, gradient and atanb
