# Banding

This document tries to explain the process of creating a Dynamic TOPMODEL from
the GIS data by agglomorating the raster cells into HSUs.

The computation of the average topographic index or gradient for a number of
raster cells grouped into an HSU is straight forward. The main challange is in
determining the computational sequence of the HSUs and there connectivity.

The computational sequence of the HSUs is required for the solutions of the 
the surface and saturated zone routings within the `dynatop` package; which
presume the inflow to the HSU is available at the time of solution.

To compute the HSUs in an appropriate computational sequence the "physical
classification" by spatial characteristics (e.g. topographic index, raster maps
of soil parameters, rainfall inputs etc.) is augmented by an additional "band
classification" based on the band of the raster cell.

The band of the raster pixel is computed from the flow directions between the
pixels such that all the cells upslope of a raster cell in band $n$ are in
cells $1$ to $n-1$. In this sense "upslope" is determined by considering any
higher pixel to be "upslope".

One option is to treat each band as it's own class. In this case the
computational sequence can exactly match the "band classification". This allows all the
connectivity between the raster cells to be represented.

However if we create a "band classification" that merges bands
together the situation is more challanging. It is presumed that bands are merged in
order: that is band $n$ can be merged with bands $n-1$ and/or band $n+1$ but
cannot be merged with band $n-1$ and/or $n+2$ unless it is also merged with the
intervining band.

Suppose that some merging of the computational bands is used, so that when
used alongside a "physical classification" a number of HSUs are produced. To
each HSUs we ascribe an order number which is the maximum band value taken by
a pixel within the HSU. Note that multiple HSUs may have the same order.

The pixels....to be continued....
